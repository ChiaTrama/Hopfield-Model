    "\n",
    "## **Description**  \n",
    "The [Hopfield network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopfield_network), also introduced in the *Models of Theoretical Physics* course, is a simple model of neuron dynamics that can be mapped to a spin system with inhomogeneous couplings. As a result, Hopfield networks are described as **spin glasses**, with spins $ S_i $ and spin-spin interactions $ J_{ij} S_i S_j $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The full Hamiltonian of the system is:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "H[S] = -\\sum_{i<j} J_{ij} S_i S_j\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "The network is used to **store patterns** in its coupling coefficients, where $ J_{ij} = J_{ji} $.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A **pattern** $x = \\{ x_i \\mid i=1, \\dots, N \\} $ is a given spin configuration where $ x_i = S_i $ and each spin takes values $ \\pm1 $. It could, for example, represent a black (+1) and white (-1) pixel in an image.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The main properties of the Hopfield network are:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **(a) Memory Storage:** It can store $ P $ different patterns $ x^a = \\{ x^a_i \\} $ $( 1 \\leq a \\leq P )$ as long as $ P $ is much smaller than the number of spins $ N $.  \n",
    "- **(b) Pattern Recovery:** It can retrieve a pattern $ x^a $ from a corrupted version $ y^a $ by minimizing the system's energy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Datasets**  \n",
    "- **(a) Random arrays and patterns.**  \n",
    "- **(b) The MNIST database of handwritten digits.**  \n",
    "  - In this case, the group must find a way to define \\( P = 10 \\) patterns corresponding to the 10 digits (0,1,2,...,9).  \n",

    "## **Assignments**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The project aims to **simulate a Hopfield network** by performing the following tasks:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(a) Pattern Storage**  \n",
    "- Generate or read from a file $ P $ patterns and imprint their values into the coupling matrix $ J_{ij} $.  \n",
    "- The couplings are set as:  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  J_{ij} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{a=1}^{P} x^a_i x^a_j\n",
    "  $$  \n",
    "- Note that a mean-field version is adopted if all pairs $ (1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq P) $ are used, as presented in the theoretical course.  \n",
    "- If using 2D images as patterns, alternative versions can be explored, such as restricting nonzero couplings to spins within a given distance $ R $ from each other.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(b) Corrupting Patterns**  \n",
    "- Generate corrupted patterns $\\{y^a\\}$, for example, by copying each $y^a_i = x^a_i$ with probability $q<1$, otherwise setting  $y^a_i = -x^a_i$ with probability $(1 – q)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(c) Pattern Recovery**  \n",
    "- cover the patterns from progressively more corrupted $y^a$, obtained by increasing $q$, till the point where it becomes difficult to get back to the original patterns xa. \n",
    "- The recovery may be implemented with different methods:  \n",
    "  1. **Iterative sign rule:**  \n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     S_i(t+1) = \\text{sign} \\left( \\sum_j J_{ij} S_j(t) \\right)\n",
    "     $$\n",
    "     starting from $ S(0) = y^a $.  \n",
    "  2. **Monte Carlo approach:**  \n",
    "     - Minimize the Hamiltonian using **random spin flips** and the **Metropolis rule**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(d) Pattern Overlap**  \n",
    "- Check how much pattern overlap is allowed while keeping each pattern distinguishable from the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(e) Results and Findings**  \n",
