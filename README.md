## Project Description
This project implements a comprehensive analysis of the Hopfield model for pattern recognition and image reconstruction using Python. Developed as part of the Laboratory of Computational Physics A (Advanced Python) course for the academic year 2023-2024, our work explores the application of the Hopfield network to both 2D random patterns and the MNIST dataset. We investigate various algorithm optimizations, including different update rules and temperature effects, to assess the model's effectiveness and limitations.
